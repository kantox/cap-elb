	    # Associate a group of EC2 instances behind a load balancer with a role to be used for Capistrano tasks. In order to use this, you
	    # must use the Load Balancer feature in Amazon EC2 to group your servers
	    # by role.
	    # 
	    # In order to use the loadbalancer extension in your capistrano scripts.
	    # you will need to install the `cap-elb` plugin, then krequire it in your `deploy.rb`:

	    # 	require 'cap-elb'

	    # If you have already been doing capistrano deploys to your AWS instances, you probably already have your
	    # AWD credentials configured.  Either add your credentials to your ~/.caprc :

	    # 	set :aws_access_key_id, 'YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'
	    # 	set :aws_secret_access_key, 'YOUR_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY'

	    # or, directly in your deploy file:

	    # 	set :aws_access_key_id, 'YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'
	    # 	set :aws_secret_access_key, 'YOUR_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY'

	    # If you wish, you can also set other AWS specfic parameters:

	    # 	set :aws_params, :region => 'us-east-1'
	    
	    # In order to define your instance groups, you must specify the security group name, the roles and params.
	    # Next you will set up your instance sets associated with a named load balancer instance in your AWS account.
	    # You will call out the load balancer name (e.g. 'lb_webserver'), the capistrano role associated with that load balancer (.e.g. 'web'),
	    # and any optional params.

	    # 	loadbalancer :lb_webserver, :web
	    # 	loadbalancer :lb_appserver, :app
	    # 	loadbalancer :lb_dbserver, :db, :port => 22000

	    # There are two special parameters you can add, :require and :exclude.

	    # AWS instances have top level metadata and user defined tag data, and this data can be used by your loadbalancer rule
	    #  to include or exclude certain instances from the instance set.

	    # Take the :require keyword; Lets say  we only want to deploy to AWS instances which are in the 'running' state. To do that:

	    # 	loadbalancer :lb_appserver, :app, :require => { :aws_state => "running" }

	    # The server set defined here for role :app are all instances in the loadbalancer 'lb_appserver' with aws_state set to 'running'.

	    # Perhaps you have added tags to your instances, if so, you might want to deploy to only the instances meeting a specific tag value:

	    # 	loadbalancer :lb_appserver, :app, :require => { :aws_state => "running", :tags => {'fleet_color' => "green", 'tier' => 'free'} }

	    # The server set defined here for role :app are all instances in the loadbalancer 'lb_appserver' with aws_state set to 'running',
	    # and that have the named 2 tags set, with exactly those values for each.  There can be other tags in the instance, but the named tags in the rule must be present
	    # for the given instance to make it into the server set.

	    # Now consider the :exclude keyword; Lets say we do not want to deploy to AWS instances which are 'micro' sized. To do that:
	    
	    # 	loadbalancer :lb_appserver, :app, :exclude => { :aws_instance_type => "t1.micro"  }

	    # You can exclude instances that have certain tags:

	    # 	loadbalancer :lb_appserver, :app, :exclude => { :aws_instance_type => "t1.micro", :tags => {'state' => 'dontdeploy' }  }

	    # When your capistrono script is complete, you can deploy to all instances within the ELB that meet your criteria with:

	    # 	% cap deploy

	    # Here's an example of a task that does a quick list of the instance ids (if any) within the load balancer associated with the 'app' role
	    # that meets the criteria you laid out in the loadbalancer definition line, 
	    # add this to your cap deploy file:

	    # 	# run with cap ec2:list
	    # 	namespace :ec2 do
	    # 		desc "list instances"
	    # 		task :list, :roles => :app do
	    # 			run "hostname"
	    # 		end
	    # 	end

	    # This will give you the list of hosts behind the load balancer that meet the criteria.
	    # 	% cap ec2:list
